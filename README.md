# Hello there :wave:


My name is Johan Almanzar and I am a 4th year CS & Physics nerd! This whole git repo serves as a way for me to track my progress through each Generate Technical task. I will keep a separate directory for each task, so as to keep my thoughts/notes along the way contained to the appropriate task! I am super excited for all the challenges that I will get the chance to learn from!!


> Oh yeah, I will also note that I am only expected to complete one track out of the three, however, my goal is to complete all three because I am a little bit of an overachiever :grin: anddddd I have a bit of time to complete as much as I can!
> Oh how naive I was, I unfortunately only got through the first track, however, this is perfectly fine! I prefer to be more diligent and focused than spread out to multiple different things at once!
