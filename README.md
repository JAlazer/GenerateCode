# Hello there :wave:


My name is Johan Almanzar and I am a 4th year CS & Physics nerd! This whole git repo serves as a way for me to track my progress through each Generate Technical task. I will keep a separate directory for each task, so as to keep my thoughts/notes along the way contained to the appropriate task! I am super excited for all the challenges that I will get the chance to learn from!!
